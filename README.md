# Automated-Network-Port-Scanner-

Project Overview :-

Developed a multi-port scanning tool using Python socket programming to identify open ports and active services. This tool simulates the reconnaissance phase of penetration testing for early-stage vulnerability discovery.

✨ Key Features:-

Multi-port Scanning: Efficiently identifies active network services across multiple ports.

Performance Optimization: Implemented timeout handling and exception management for reliable scanning.

Reconnaissance Tool: Designed specifically for network security auditing and auditing active services.

🚀 How to Run:-
1.Ensure Python is installed.

2.Run: python scanner.py
